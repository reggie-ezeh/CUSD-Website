CUSD on reaching out:
"In collaboration with United World Schools (UWS) and Diyalo Foundation, CUSD is improving the architectural design of primary schools to create a sustainable and user friendly environment for education. We will examine the local community, culture, and resources, to fulfill the needs of local students, providing them equal opportunities for education."

CUSD Mission:
"Challenge students to create dynamic and innovative solutions for economic, social, and ecological difficulties faced by the global community."

Marketing and Communications connects stakeholders, students and members with CUSD through storytelling and experiential marketing, both offline and online.

"We bring inspirations to our audience and bring their passion and insights to search for ways to involve them in our journey to create sustainable impact around the world. We also play a vital role in setting directions for and ensuring consistency in CUSDÔøΩs visual identity. We are responsible for communicating our values through recruitment, events, social and partnership.

These specialized websites enable us to engage with and educate target audiences during outreach events."


The Currents project uses intelligent occupancy sensing to control the heating system for academic (single professor) offices. Air conditioning and ventilation make up 53% of energy use in commercial buildings. Using cutting edge technologies including machine learning, smartphone applications, sensors, and wearables we are designing a system that will accurately predict whether a professor is in their office and turn their heating on/off based on this data. Currents applies computer science and electrical engineering skills to develop a system that offers substantial energy savings

Project Tiny Home
The goal of this project is to create a mobile tiny home with hands-on, interactive exhibits that show the inner workings of energy efficient features, renewable energy, and other home technologies. This tiny home will then be brought to diverse audiences throughout the area to educate them on easy, cost saving techniques they can implement in their homes.

Solarize aims to spark Cornell GroundsÔøΩ transition to carbon neutrality by replacing traditional energy sources with solar technology.

Our first project involves developing a solar trailer which will provide on-the-go sustainable energy for the maintenance of Cornell's campus. Once this is implemented, we hope to expand our efforts to additional renewable energy projects within Cornell Grounds and the surrounding community.

Our Purpose
Empowering people to make a sustainable impact within their own community.

Our Mission
Challenge students to create dynamic and innovative solutions for economic, social, and ecological difficulties faced by the global community.

Our organization is a diverse family of students with one common goal- to impact the global community through holistic sustainability. Through collaboration we create innovative ways to integrate technology and sustainability into community teams in a way that engages the surrounding community.

‚ÄúLED lightbulbs are 80% more efficient than traditional lighting such as fluorescent and incandescent lights. They have longer life spans, draw less power than traditional lighting, and do not contain toxic elements that would otherwise contaminate the environment once the bulbs are disposed of. Using LED lightbulbs in your home is an easy way to save money, energy and the environment!‚Äù - Alex Vompe üí° #cusdlifehacks #cusd #sustainableliving #sustainability #ledlights #led #energyefficiency
"When food decomposes in a landfill it's likely that it's undergoing anaerobic breakdown which results in the release of methane (a much more potent greenhouse gas). However, composting allows the scraps to undergo an aerobic decomposition process, which will result in the release of CO2. For this reason, I keep a small container to compost food scraps I may have back at my dorm from cooking, and bring them over to MVR to be composted. Not only can I make a difference, but I also get to be a role model." - Brandon Hoak #sustainableliving #composting #compost #cusdlifehacks #cusd how do YOU promote a sustainable lifestyle?

‚ÄúThe fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world, just after oil. For this reason, I have been boycotting fast fashion for the past few years. Now I only buy clothing secondhand or from ethical brands. Thrifting is a great way to give clothing that would otherwise end up in a landfill a second life.‚Äù - Erika Kane #cusdlifehacks #sustainableliving #sustainablefashion #secondhand #sustainabilitymatters #lifestyle How do YOU promote sustainability in your daily life?
